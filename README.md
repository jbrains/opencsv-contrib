# opencsv-contrib

I started using [opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) in a project. I created a tiny local extension. I thought it might be nice to publish it as a public project. I don't know at what point you might find this helpful. Please feel invited to contribute issues and pull requests, in order to increase the chances that someone will find this useful.

## Records

I became interested in this because I wanted to refactor a value object into a Record. I didn't immediately see how to make **opencsv** read CSV content into a Record, so I added it. That's where this project started. Accordingly, **this project will depend on recent versions of Java**. If you notice that we can safely depend on _older_ versions of Java, then please contribute that information so that we can expand the potential user base.
